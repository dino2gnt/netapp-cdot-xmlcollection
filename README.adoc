= NetApp http api xml collection for OpenNMS

== Installation
Clone this, merge it with your config.  There's some hacky requirement on the NetApp api regarding the dtd needing to exist in /etc (iirc) so if you see errors about namespaces
and such, copy the netapp_gx.dtd included here to /etc/netapp_gx.dtd on your opennms server and/or minions.

== Configuration
We authenticate using Basic auth, so you'll need to update the Authorization header in xml-datacollection-config.xml to use the correct credentials, for all three collection groups.

== Graphs
In the Grafana subdirectory, there are graphs for:

  Node Performance Statistics
  Vserver Performance Statistics
  Volume Performance Statistics
  Snapmirror Statistics

You will likely have to massage these to make them work in your environment, specifically the node filters and resource filters used.
